Vizney is a space for those who want to create more effective data visualizations. We share practical chart guides and tips to help anyone build intuitive and persuasive visuals.

Based on hands-on experience, we explore how to solve complex problems with clarity. Starting from everyday questions, we aim to provide solutions that are simple yet practical.

To us, good chart design isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about understanding data structure and message. Vizney is here as a companion in that journey.
